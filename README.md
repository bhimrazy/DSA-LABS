## Usage

Clone the repo and compile each .cpp file for the output.

## Setup

You will need to have g++ compiler in order to run this demo. [MinGW](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html) is a good choice!

```
g++ file.cpp

```

### Interesting things to try

Make some changes in the code and observe the output.
